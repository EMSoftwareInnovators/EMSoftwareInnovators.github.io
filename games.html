                        <h3> About these games</h3>
                        <p>Before attending college, my first foray into software development was making video games. After spending over a year learning the basics of programming, I set a goal in the summer of 2016 to have a simple video game built within a year. Although I was still very new to programming these games taught me many core components of programming, including good code commenting, structured arrays, and basic AI logic.</p>
                        <p>These games were built in Unity Engine. The majority of the code for both games is in C#. However, all of the save and load functions were programmed in Java, since it was determined that Unity was able to load assets faster when programmed in Java at the time of building these games.</p>
